/* -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EggBuffer
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is pure vanila standard C, no glib. We need this
 * because certain consumers of this protocol need to be built
 * without linking in any special libraries. ie: the PKCS#11 module.
 *
 * Memory Allocation
 *
 * Callers can set their own allocator. If NULL is used then standard
 * C library heap memory is used and failures will not be fatal. Memory
 * failures will instead result in a zero return value or
 * egg_buffer_has_error() returning one.
 *
 * If you use something like g_realloc as the allocator, then memory
 * failures become fatal just like in a standard GTK program.
 *
 * Don't change the allocator manually in the EggBuffer structure. The
 * egg_buffer_set_allocator() func will reallocate and handle things
 * properly.
 *
 * Pointers into the Buffer
 *
 * Any write operation has the posibility of reallocating memory
 * and invalidating any direct pointers into the buffer.
